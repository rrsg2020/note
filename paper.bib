  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Visual but subjective reading of longitudinal
              relaxation time (T1) weighted magnetic resonance images is
              commonly used for the detection of brain pathologies. For this
              non-quantitative measure, diagnostic quality depends on hardware
              configuration, imaging parameters, radio frequency transmission
              field (B1+) uniformity, as well as observer experience.
              Parametric quantification of the tissue T1 relaxation parameter
              offsets the propensity for these effects, but is typically time
              consuming. For this reason, this study examines the feasibility
              of rapid 2D T1 quantification using a variable flip angles (VFA)
              approach at magnetic field strengths of 1.5 Tesla, 3 Tesla, and 7
              Tesla. These efforts include validation in phantom experiments
              and application for brain T1 mapping. METHODS: T1 quantification
              included simulations of the Bloch equations to correct for slice
              profile imperfections, and a correction for B1+. Fast gradient
              echo acquisitions were conducted using three adjusted flip angles
              for the proposed T1 quantification approach that was benchmarked
              against slice profile uncorrected 2D VFA and an
              inversion-recovery spin-echo based reference method. Brain T1
              mapping was performed in six healthy subjects, one multiple
              sclerosis patient, and one stroke patient. RESULTS: Phantom
              experiments showed a mean T1 estimation error of (-63$\pm$1.5)\%
              for slice profile uncorrected 2D VFA and (0.2$\pm$1.4)\% for the
              proposed approach compared to the reference method. Scan time for
              single slice T1 mapping including B1+ mapping could be reduced to
              5 seconds using an in-plane resolution of (2$\times$2) mm2, which
              equals a scan time reduction of more than 99\% compared to the
              reference method. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that rapid
              2D T1 quantification using a variable flip angle approach is
              feasible at 1.5T/3T/7T. It represents a valuable alternative for
              rapid T1 mapping due to the gain in speed versus conventional
              approaches. This progress may serve to enhance the capabilities
              of parametric MR based lesion detection and brain tissue

              presented. The approach combines a gold standard scanning
              procedure with a novel fitting procedure. Fitting complex data to
              a five-parameter model ensures accuracy and precision of the T(1)
              estimation. A reduced-dimension nonlinear least squares method is
              proposed. This method turns the complicated multi-parameter
              minimization into a straightforward one-dimensional search. As
              the range of possible T(1) values is known, a global grid search
              can be used, ensuring that a global optimal solution is found.
              When only magnitude data are available, the algorithm is adapted
              to concurrently restore polarity. The performance of the new
              algorithm is demonstrated in simulations and phantom experiments.
              The new algorithm is as accurate and precise as the
              conventionally used Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm but much

              temperature, species, in vivo versus in vitro status, time after

              tissue type and NMR frequency (V). All tissue frequency
              dispersions can be fitted to the simple expression T1 = AVB in

              This equation provides as good or better fit to the data as
              previous more complex formulas. T2 is found to be multicomponent,
              essentially independent of NMR frequency, and dependent mainly on
              tissue type. Mean and raw values of T1 and T2 for each tissue are
              tabulated and/or plotted versus frequency and the fitting
              parameters A, B and the standard deviations determined to
              establish the normal range of relaxation times applicable to NMR

              This suggests that 1H tissue T1 is determined predominantly by
              intermolecular (possibly rotational) interactions between
              macromolecules and a single bound hydration layer, and the T2 is
              governed mainly by exchange diffusion of water between the bound
              layer and a free water phase. Deficiencies in measurement

              vendor-neutral sequences decrease inter-vendor variability of T1,
              magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and magnetization transfer
              saturation-index (MTsat) measurements. METHODS: We developed and
              deployed a vendor-neutral 3D spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR)
              sequence on three clinical scanners by two MRI vendors. We then
              acquired T1 maps on the ISMRM-NIST system phantom, as well as T1,
              MTR, and MTsat maps in three healthy participants. We performed
              hierarchical shift function analysis in vivo to characterize the
              differences between scanners when the vendor-neutral sequence is
              used instead of commercial vendor implementations. Inter-vendor
              deviations were compared for statistical significance to test the
              hypothesis. RESULTS: In the phantom, the vendor-neutral sequence
              reduced inter-vendor differences from 8\% to 19.4\% to 0.2\% to
              5\% with an overall accuracy improvement, reducing ground truth
              T1 deviations from 7\% to 11\% to 0.2\% to 4\%. In vivo, we found
              that the variability between vendors is significantly reduced (p
              = 0.015) for all maps (T1, MTR, and MTsat) using the
              vendor-neutral sequence. CONCLUSION: We conclude that
              vendor-neutral workflows are feasible and compatible with
              clinical MRI scanners. The significant reduction of inter-vendor
              variability using vendor-neutral sequences has important

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: T1 mapping allows direct in-vivo quantitation of
              microscopic changes in the myocardium, providing new diagnostic
              insights into cardiac disease. Existing methods require long
              breath holds that are demanding for many cardiac patients. In
              this work we propose and validate a novel, clinically applicable,
              pulse sequence for myocardial T1-mapping that is compatible with
              typical limits for end-expiration breath-holding in patients.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Shortened MOdified Look-Locker
              Inversion recovery (ShMOLLI) method uses sequential inversion
              recovery measurements within a single short breath-hold. Full
              recovery of the longitudinal magnetisation between sequential
              inversion pulses is not achieved, but conditional interpretation
              of samples for reconstruction of T1-maps is used to yield
              accurate measurements, and this algorithm is implemented directly
              on the scanner. We performed computer simulations for 100 ms<T1 <
              2.7 s and heart rates 40-100 bpm followed by phantom validation
              at 1.5T and 3T. In-vivo myocardial T1-mapping using this method
              and the previous gold-standard (MOLLI) was performed in 10
              healthy volunteers at 1.5T and 3T, 4 volunteers with contrast
              injection at 1.5T, and 4 patients with recent myocardial
              infarction (MI) at 3T. RESULTS: We found good agreement between
              the average ShMOLLI and MOLLI estimates for T1 < 1200 ms. In
              contrast to the original method, ShMOLLI showed no dependence on
              heart rates for long T1 values, with estimates characterized by a
              constant 4\% underestimation for T1 = 800-2700 ms. In-vivo,
              ShMOLLI measurements required 9.0 $\pm$ 1.1 s (MOLLI = 17.6 $\pm$
              2.9 s). Average healthy myocardial T1 s by ShMOLLI at 1.5T were
              966 $\pm$ 48 ms (mean $\pm$ SD) and 1166 $\pm$ 60 ms at 3T. In MI
              patients, the T1 in unaffected myocardium (1216 $\pm$ 42 ms) was
              similar to controls at 3T. Ischemically injured myocardium showed
              increased T1 = 1432 $\pm$ 33 ms (p < 0.001). The difference
              between MI and remote myocardium was estimated 15\% larger by
              ShMOLLI than MOLLI (p < 0.04) which suffers from heart rate
              dependencies for long T1. The in-vivo variability within ShMOLLI
              T1-maps was only 14\% (1.5T) or 18\% (3T) higher than the MOLLI
              maps, but the MOLLI acquisitions were twice longer than ShMOLLI

  abstract = "Recent years have seen an increased understanding of the
              importance of myelination in healthy brain function and
              neuropsychiatric diseases. Non-invasive microstructural magnetic
              resonance imaging (MRI) holds the potential to expand and
              translate these insights to basic and clinical human research,
              but the sensitivity and specificity of different MR markers to
              myelination is a subject of debate. To consolidate current
              knowledge on the topic, we perform a systematic review and
              meta-analysis of studies that validate microstructural imaging by
              combining it with myelin histology. We find meta-analytic
              evidence for correlations between various myelin histology
              metrics and markers from different MRI modalities, including
              fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, macromolecular pool,
              magnetization transfer ratio, susceptibility and longitudinal
              relaxation rate, but not mean diffusivity. Meta-analytic
              correlation effect sizes range widely, between R2 = 0.26 and R2 =
              0.82. However, formal comparisons between MRI-based myelin
              markers are limited by methodological variability, inconsistent
              reporting and potential for publication bias, thus preventing the
              establishment of a single most sensitive strategy to measure
              myelin with MRI. To facilitate further progress, we provide a
              detailed characterisation of the evaluated studies as an online

               mapping) have been shown to be more reproducible across time and
               vendors than weighted (e.g., T1 -weighted) images. The purpose
               of this work was to more extensively evaluate the validity of
               this assertion. METHODS: Seven volunteers underwent
               twice-repeated acquisitions of variable flip-angle T1 mapping,
               including B1 + calibration, on a 3T Philips Achieva and 3T
               Siemens Trio scanner. Intra-scanner and inter-vendor T1
               variability were calculated. To determine T1 reproducibility
               levels in longitudinal settings, or after changing hardware or
               software, four additional data sets were acquired from two of
               the participants; one participant was scanned on a different 3T
               Siemens Trio scanner and another on the same 3T Philips Achieva
               scanner but after a software upgrade. RESULTS: Intra-scanner
               variability of voxel-wise T1 values was consistent between the
               two vendors, averaging 0.7/0.7/1.3/1.4\% in white
               matter/cortical gray matter/subcortical gray matter/cerebellum,
               respectively. We observed, however, a systematic bias between
               the two vendors of https://doi.org/10.0/7.8/8.6/10.0\%,
               respectively. The T1 bias across two scanners of the same model
               was greater than intra-scanner variability, although still only
               at 1.4/1.0/1.9/2.3\%, respectively. A greater bias was
               identified for data sets acquired before/after software upgrade
               in white matter/cortical gray matter (3.6/2.7\%) whereas
               variability in subcortical gray matter/cerebellum was comparable
               (1.7/1.9\%). CONCLUSION: We established intra- and inter-vendor
               reproducibility levels for a widely used T1 mapping protocol. We
               anticipate that these results will guide the design of
               multi-center studies, particularly those encompassing multiple
               vendors. Furthermore, this baseline level of reproducibility

  abstract = "PURPOSE: A standard MRI system phantom has been designed and
              fabricated to assess scanner performance, stability,
              comparability and assess the accuracy of quantitative relaxation
              time imaging. The phantom is unique in having traceability to the
              International System of Units, a high level of precision, and
              monitoring by a national metrology institute. Here, we describe
              the phantom design, construction, imaging protocols, and
              measurement of geometric distortion, resolution, slice profile,
              signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), proton-spin relaxation times, image
              uniformity and proton density. METHODS: The system phantom,
              designed by the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in
              Medicine ad hoc committee on Standards for Quantitative MR, is a
              200 mm spherical structure that contains a 57-element fiducial
              array; two relaxation time arrays; a proton density/SNR array;
              resolution and slice-profile insets. Standard imaging protocols
              are presented, which provide rapid assessment of geometric
              distortion, image uniformity, T1 and T2 mapping, image
              resolution, slice profile, and SNR. RESULTS: Fiducial array
              analysis gives assessment of intrinsic geometric distortions,
              which can vary considerably between scanners and correction
              techniques. This analysis also measures scanner/coil image
              uniformity, spatial calibration accuracy, and local volume
              distortion. An advanced resolution analysis gives both scanner
              and protocol contributions. SNR analysis gives both temporal and
              spatial contributions. CONCLUSIONS: A standard system phantom is
              useful for characterization of scanner performance, monitoring a
              scanner over time, and to compare different scanners. This type
              of calibration structure is useful for quality assurance,
              benchmarking quantitative MRI protocols, and to transition MRI
              from a qualitative imaging technique to a precise metrology with
              documented accuracy and uncertainty.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: T1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) have the
              potential to guide patient care and serve as surrogate end-points
              in clinical trials, but measurements differ between
              cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scanners and pulse
              sequences. To help deliver T1 mapping to global clinical care, we
              developed a phantom-based quality assurance (QA) system for
              verification of measurement stability over time at individual
              sites, with further aims of generalization of results across
              sites, vendor systems, software versions and imaging sequences.
              We thus created T1MES: The T1 Mapping and ECV Standardization
              Program. METHODS: A design collaboration consisting of a
              specialist MRI small-medium enterprise, clinicians, physicists
              and national metrology institutes was formed. A phantom was
              designed covering clinically relevant ranges of T1 and T2 in
              blood and myocardium, pre and post-contrast, for 1.5 T and 3 T.
              Reproducible mass manufacture was established. The device
              received regulatory clearance by the Food and Drug Administration
              (FDA) and Conformit{\'e} Europ{\'e}ene (CE) marking. RESULTS: The
              T1MES phantom is an agarose gel-based phantom using nickel
              chloride as the paramagnetic relaxation modifier. It was
              reproducibly specified and mass-produced with a rigorously
              repeatable process. Each phantom contains nine differently-doped
              agarose gel tubes embedded in a gel/beads matrix. Phantoms were
              free of air bubbles and susceptibility artifacts at both field
              strengths and T1 maps were free from off-resonance artifacts. The
              incorporation of high-density polyethylene beads in the main gel
              fill was effective at flattening the B 1 field. T1 and T2 values
              measured in T1MES showed coefficients of variation of 1 \% or
              less between repeat scans indicating good short-term
              reproducibility. Temperature dependency experiments confirmed
              that over the range 15-30 °C the short-T1 tubes were more stable
              with temperature than the long-T1 tubes. A batch of 69 phantoms
              was mass-produced with random sampling of ten of these showing
              coefficients of variations for T1 of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.45 \% and 0.49
              $\pm$ 0.34 \% at 1.5 T and 3 T respectively. CONCLUSION: The
              T1MES program has developed a T1 mapping phantom to CE/FDA
              manufacturing standards. An initial 69 phantoms with a
              multi-vendor user manual are now being scanned fortnightly in
              centers worldwide. Future results will explore T1 mapping
              sequences, platform performance, stability and the potential for
              standardization.",

              quantification protocols used for dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI
              at 1.5 and 3 T. METHODS: A T1 phantom with 14 samples was imaged
              at eight centers with a common inversion-recovery spin-echo
              (IR-SE) protocol and a variable flip angle (VFA) protocol using
              seven flip angles, as well as site-specific protocols (VFA with
              different flip angles, variable repetition time, proton density,
              and Look-Locker inversion recovery). Factors influencing the
              accuracy (deviation from reference NMR T1 measurements) and
              repeatability were assessed using general linear mixed models.
              Interplatform reproducibility was assessed using coefficients of
              variation. RESULTS: For the common IR-SE protocol, accuracy
              (median error across platforms = 1.4-5.5\%) was influenced
              predominantly by T1 sample (P < 10-6 ), whereas test-retest
              repeatability (median error = 0.2-8.3\%) was influenced by the
              scanner (P < 10-6 ). For the common VFA protocol, accuracy
              (median error = 5.7-32.2\%) was influenced by field strength (P =
              0.006), whereas repeatability (median error = 0.7-25.8\%) was
              influenced by the scanner (P < 0.0001). Interplatform
              reproducibility with the common VFA was lower at 3 T than 1.5 T
              (P = 0.004), and lower than that of the common IR-SE protocol
              (coefficient of variation 1.5T: VFA/IR-SE = 11.13\%/8.21\%, P =
              0.028; 3 T: VFA/IR-SE = 22.87\%/5.46\%, P = 0.001). Among the
              site-specific protocols, Look-Locker inversion recovery and VFA
              (2-3 flip angles) protocols showed the best accuracy and
              repeatability (errors < 15\%). CONCLUSIONS: The VFA protocols
              with 2 to 3 flip angles optimized for different applications
              achieved acceptable balance of extensive spatial coverage,
              accuracy, and repeatability in T1 quantification (errors < 15\%).
              Further optimization in terms of flip-angle choice for each
              tissue application, and the use of B1 correction, are needed to

               logic portably. To introduce a new MRI sequence development
               approach which utilizes flexibly reusable modules. METHODS: The
               proposed sequence description contains a sequence module
               hierarchy for loop and group logic, which is enhanced by a novel
               strategy for performing efficient parameter and pulse shape
               calculation. These calculations are powered by a flow graph
               structure. By using the flow graph, all calculations are
               performed with no redundancy and without requiring
               preprocessing. The generation of this interpretable structure is
               a separate step that combines MRI techniques while actively
               considering their context. The driver interface is slim and
               highly flexible through scripting support. The sequences do not
               require any vendor-specific compiling or processing step. A
               vendor-independent frontend for sequence configuration can be
               used. Tests that ensure physical feasibility of the sequence are
               integrated into the calculation logic. RESULTS: The framework
               was used to define a set of standard sequences. Resulting images
               were compared to respective images acquired with sequences
               provided by the device manufacturer. Images were acquired using
               a standard commercial MRI system. CONCLUSIONS: The approach
               produces configurable, vendor-independent sequences, whose

               steady-state free-precession (SSFP) technique, combined with
               sensitivity encoding to achieve a data acquisition window of <

              clinical tool in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to
              objectively distinguish normal from diseased myocardium. The
              usefulness of any quantitative technique to identify disease lies
              in its ability to detect significant differences from an
              established range of normal values. We aimed to assess the
              variability of myocardial T1 relaxation times in the normal human
              population estimated with recently proposed Shortened Modified
              Look-Locker Inversion recovery (ShMOLLI) T1 mapping technique.
              METHODS: A large cohort of healthy volunteers (n = 342, 50\%
              females, age 11-69 years) from 3 clinical centres across two
              countries underwent CMR at 1.5T. Each examination provided a
              single average myocardial ShMOLLI T1 estimate using manually
              drawn myocardial contours on typically 3 short axis slices
              (average 3.4 $\pm$ 1.4), taking care not to include any blood
              pool in the myocardial contours. We established the normal
              reference range of myocardial and blood T1 values, and assessed
              the effect of potential confounding factors, including artefacts,
              partial volume, repeated measurements, age, gender, body size,
              hematocrit and heart rate. RESULTS: Native myocardial ShMOLLI T1
              was 962 $\pm$ 25 ms. We identify the partial volume as primary
              source of potential error in the analysis of respective T1 maps
              and use 1 pixel erosion to represent ``midwall myocardial'' T1,
              resulting in a 0.9\% decrease to 953 $\pm$ 23 ms. Midwall
              myocardial ShMOLLI T1 was reproducible with an intra-individual,
              intra- and inter-scanner variability of $\leq$2\%. The principle
              biological parameter influencing myocardial ShMOLLI T1 was the
              female gender, with female T1 longer by 24 ms up to the age of 45
              years, after which there was no significant difference from
              males. After correction for age and gender dependencies, heart
              rate was the only other physiologic factor with a small effect on
              myocardial ShMOLLI T1 (6ms/10bpm). Left and right ventricular
              blood ShMOLLI T1 correlated strongly with each other and also
              with myocardial T1 with the slope of 0.1 that is justifiable by
              the resting partition of blood volume in myocardial tissue.
              Overall, the effect of all variables on myocardial ShMOLLI T1 was
              within 2\% of relative changes from the average. CONCLUSION:
              Native T1-mapping using ShMOLLI generates reproducible and
              consistent results in normal individuals within 2\% of relative
              changes from the average, well below the effects of most acute
              forms of myocardial disease. The main potential confounder is the
              partial volume effect arising from over-inclusion of neighbouring
              tissue at the manual stages of image analysis. In the study of
              cardiac conditions such as diffuse fibrosis or small focal
              changes, the use of ``myocardial midwall'' T1, age and gender
              matching, and compensation for heart rate differences may all
              help to improve the method sensitivity in detecting subtle
              changes. As the accuracy of current T1 measurement methods
              remains to be established, this study does not claim to report an
              accurate measure of T1, but that ShMOLLI is a stable and
              reproducible method for T1-mapping.",

              (ISMRM/NIST) system phantom to assess variations of T1
              measurements, using a slow, reference standard inversion recovery
              sequence and a rapid, commonly-available variable flip angle
              sequence, across MRI systems at 1.5 tesla (T) (two vendors, with
              number of MRI systems n = 9) and 3 T (three vendors, n = 18). We
              compared the T1 measurements from inversion recovery and variable
              flip angle scans to ISMRM/NIST phantom reference values using
              Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to test for statistical differences
              between T1 measurements grouped according to MRI scanner
              manufacturers and/or static field strengths. The inversion
              recovery method had minor over- and under-estimations compared to
              the NMR-measured T1 values at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Variable flip
              angle measurements had substantially greater deviations from the
              NMR-measured T1 values than the inversion recovery measurements.
              At 3 T, the measured variable flip angle T1 for one vendor is
              significantly different than the other two vendors for most of
              the samples throughout the clinically relevant range of T1. There
              was no consistent pattern of discrepancy between vendors. We

              neurological disease. Nineteen subjects, 8 female and 11 male,
              were studied for T1 and T2 measurements, and 7 males were studied

              low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence with 14 different echo times for
              T2. Results of the measurements are summarized as follows.
              Average T1 values measured for gray matter and white matter were
              1331 and 832 msec, respectively. Average T2 values measured for

              and frontal white matter were 48.4 and 44.7 msec, respectively.
              ANOVA tests of the measurements revealed that for both gray and

              differences in T1 values from the left hemisphere compared with
              the right, except in insular gray matter, where this difference
              was significant at P = 0.0320. No significant difference in T2

              estimation for head and neck (HN) dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)
              MRI with dual-flip-angle (DFA) T1 mapping. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
              Clinical DCE-MRI datasets of 23 patients with HN tumors were
              included in this study. T1 maps were generated based on
              multiple-flip-angle (MFA) method and different DFA combinations.
              Tofts model parameter maps of k(ep), K(trans) and v(p) based on
              MFA and DFAs were calculated and compared. Fitted parameter by
              MFA and DFAs were quantitatively evaluated in primary tumor,
              salivary gland and muscle. RESULTS: T1 mapping deviations by DFAs
              produced remarkable kinetic parameter estimation deviations in
              head and neck tissues. In particular, the DFA of [2º, 7º]
              overestimated, while [7º, 12º] and [7º, 15º] underestimated
              K(trans) and v(p), significantly (P<0.01). [2º, 15º] achieved the
              smallest but still statistically significant overestimation for
              K(trans) and v(p) in primary tumors, 32.1\% and 16.2\%
              respectively. k(ep) fitting results by DFAs were relatively close
              to the MFA reference compared to K(trans) and v(p). CONCLUSIONS:
              T1 deviations induced by DFA could result in significant errors
              in kinetic parameter estimation, particularly K(trans) and v(p),
              through Tofts model fitting. MFA method should be more reliable

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The widespread clinical application of quantitative MRI
              has been hindered by a lack of reproducibility across sites and
              vendors. Previous work has attributed this to incorrect B1
              mapping or insufficient spoiling conditions. We recently proposed
              the controlled saturation magnetization transfer (CSMT) framework
              and hypothesized that the lack of reproducibility can also be
              attributed to magnetization transfer effects. This work seeks to
              validate this hypothesis and demonstrate that reproducible
              multivendor single-pool relaxometry can be achieved with the CSMT
              approach. METHODS: Three healthy volunteers were scanned on
              scanners from 3 vendors (GE Healthcare, Philips, Siemens). An
              extensive set of images necessary for joint T1 and T2 estimation
              were acquired with (1) each vendor default RF pulses and spoiling
              conditions; (2) harmonized RF spoiling; and (3) harmonized RF
              spoiling and CSMT pulses. Different subsets of images were used
              to generate 6 different T1 and T2 maps for each subject's data
              from each vendor. Cross-protocol, cross-vendor, and test/retest
              variability were estimated. RESULTS: Harmonized RF spoiling
              conditions are insufficient to ensure good cross-vendor
              reproducibility. Controlled saturation magnetization transfer
              allows cross-protocol variability to be reduced from 18.3\% to
              4.0\%. Whole-brain variability using the same protocol was
              reduced from a maximum of 19\% to 4.5\% across sites. Both CSMT
              and native vendor RF conditions have a reported variability of
              less than 5\% for repeat measures on the same vendor. CONCLUSION:
              Magnetization transfer effects are a major contributor to
              intersite/intrasite variability of T1 and T2 estimation.
              Controlled saturation magnetization transfer stabilizes these
              effects, paving the way for the use of single-pool T1 and T2 as a
              reliable source for clinical diagnosis across sites.",

  abstract  = "The application of a new Fourier transform technique to magnetic
               resonance spectroscopy is explored. The method consists of
               applying a sequence of short rf pulses to the sample to be
               investigated and Fourier?transforming the response of the
               system. The main advantages of this technique compared with the
               usual spectral sweep method are the much shorter time required
               to record a spectrum and the higher inherent sensitivity. It is
               shown theoretically and experimentally that it is possible to
               enhance the sensitivity of high resolution proton magnetic
               resonance spectroscopy in a restricted time up to a factor of
               ten or more. The time necessary to achieve the same sensitivity
               is a factor of 100 shorter than with conventional methods. The
               enhancement of the sensitivity is essentially given by the
               square root of the ratio of line width to total width of the
               spectrum. The method is of particular advantage for complicated
               high resolution spectra with much fine structure.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Implementing new magnetic resonance experiments, or
              sequences, often involves extensive programming on
              vendor-specific platforms, which can be time consuming and
              costly. This situation is exacerbated when research sequences
              need to be implemented on several platforms simultaneously, for
              example, at different field strengths. This work presents an
              alternative programming environment that is hardware-independent,
              open-source, and promotes rapid sequence prototyping. METHODS: A
              novel file format is described to efficiently store the hardware
              events and timing information required for an MR pulse sequence.
              Platform-dependent interpreter modules convert the file to
              appropriate instructions to run the sequence on MR hardware.
              Sequences can be designed in high-level languages, such as
              MATLAB, or with a graphical interface. Spin physics simulation
              tools are incorporated into the framework, allowing for
              comparison between real and virtual experiments. RESULTS: Minimal
              effort is required to implement relatively advanced sequences
              using the tools provided. Sequences are executed on three
              different MR platforms, demonstrating the flexibility of the
              approach. CONCLUSION: A high-level, flexible and
              hardware-independent approach to sequence programming is ideal
              for the rapid development of new sequences. The framework is
              currently not suitable for large patient studies or routine
              scanning although this would be possible with deeper integration

              diagnostic imaging to the patient management process. A
              hierarchical model of efficacy is presented as an organizing
              structure for appraisal of the literature on efficacy of imaging.
              Demonstration of efficacy at each lower level in this hierarchy
              is logically necessary, but not sufficient, to assure efficacy at
              higher levels. Level 1 concerns technical quality of the images;
              Level 2 addresses diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and
              specificity associated with interpretation of the images. Next,
              Level 3 focuses on whether the information produces change in the
              referring physician's diagnostic thinking. Such a change is a
              logical prerequisite for Level 4 efficacy, which concerns effect
              on the patient management plan. Level 5 efficacy studies measure
              (or compute) effect of the information on patient outcomes.
              Finally, at Level 6, analyses examine societal costs and benefits
              of a diagnostic imaging technology. The pioneering contributions

  abstract = "Purpose There are many T1 mapping methods available, each of them
              validated in phantoms and reporting excellent agreement with
              literature. However, values in literature vary greatly, with T1
              in white matter ranging from 690 to 1100 ms at 3 Tesla. This
              brings into question the accuracy of one of the most fundamental
              measurements in quantitative MRI. Our goal was to explain these
              variations and look into ways of mitigating them. Theory and
              Methods We evaluated the three most common T1 mapping methods
              (inversion recovery, Look-Locker, and variable flip angle)
              through Bloch simulations, a white matter phantom and the brains
              of 10 healthy subjects (single-slice). We pooled the T1
              histograms of the subjects to determine whether there is a
              sequence-dependent bias and whether it is reproducible across
              subjects. Results We found good agreement between the three
              methods in phantoms, but poor agreement in vivo, with the white
              matter T1 histogram peak in healthy subjects varying by more than
              30\% depending on the method used. We also found that the pooled
              brain histograms displayed three distinct white matter peaks,
              with Look-Locker consistently underestimating, and variable flip
              angle overestimating the inversion recovery T1 values. The Bloch
              simulations indicated that incomplete spoiling and inaccurate B1
              mapping could account for the observed differences. Conclusion We
              conclude that the three most common T1 mapping protocols produce
              stable T1 values in phantoms, but not in vivo. To improve the
              accuracy of T1 mapping, we recommend that sites perform in vivo
              validation of their T1 mapping method against the inversion
              recovery reference method, as the first step toward developing a
              robust calibration scheme. Magn Reson Med 73:514--522, 2015.
