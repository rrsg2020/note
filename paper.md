# Summary

We present the results of the ISMRM 2020 joint Reproducible Research and Quantitative MR study groups reproducibility challenge on T<sub>1</sub> mapping in phantom and human brain. T<sub>1</sub> mapping, a widely used quantitative MRI technique, exhibits inconsistent tissue-specific values across protocols, sites, and vendors. The challenge aimed to assess the reproducibility of a well-established inversion recovery T1 mapping technique, with acquisition details published solely as a PDF, on a standardized phantom and in human brains. Participants acquired T<sub>1</sub> mapping data from MRIs of three manufacturers at 3T, resulting in 39 phantom datasets and 56 datasets from healthy human subjects. The T<sub>1</sub> inter-submission variability was twice as high as the intra-submission variability in both phantoms and human brains, indicating that the acquisition details in the selected paper were insufficient to reproduce a quantitative MRI protocol. This study reports the inherent uncertainty in  T<sub>1</sub> measures across independent research groups, bringing us one step closer to a practical clinical baseline of  T<sub>1</sub> variations in vivo. This challenge resulted in the creation of a comprehensive open database of T<sub>1</sub> mapping acquisitions, accessible at [osf.io/ywc9g/](https://osf.io/ywc9g/), and an [interactive dashboard](https://rrsg2020.db.neurolibre.org) for wider community access and engagement.

1     |     INTRODUCTION
========================

Significant challenges exist in the reproducibility of quantitative MRI (qMRI) [@Keenan2019-ni]. Despite its promise of improving the specificity and reproducibility of MRI acquisitions, few qMRI techniques have been integrated into clinical practice. Even the most fundamental MR parameters cannot be measured with sufficient reproducibility and precision across clinical scanners to pass the second of six stages of technical assessment for clinical biomarkers [@Fryback1991-sy;@Schweitzer2016-fl;@Seiberlich2020-xe]. Half a century has passed since the first quantitative T<sub>1</sub> (spin-lattice relaxation time) measurements were first reported as a potential biomarker for tumors [@Damadian1971-sc], followed shortly thereafter by the first in vivo T<sub>1</sub> maps [@Pykett1978-mk] of tumors, but there is still disagreement in reported values for this fundamental parameter across different sites, vendors, and measurement techniques [@Stikov2015-qj].

Among fundamental MRI parameters, T<sub>1</sub> holds significant importance [@Boudreau2020-jf]. T<sub>1</sub> represents the time constant for recovery of equilibrium longitudinal magnetization. T<sub>1</sub> values will vary depending on the molecular mobility and magnetic field strength [@Bottomley1984-qx;@Wansapura1999-tf;@Dieringer2014-qz]. Knowledge of the T<sub>1</sub> values for tissue is crucial for optimizing clinical MRI sequences for contrast and time efficiency [@Ernst1966-pp;@Redpath1994-sb;@Tofts1997-ln] and to calibrate other quantitative MRI techniques [@Sled2001-fz;Yuan2012-xh]. Inversion recovery (IR) [@Drain1949-yk;@Hahn1949-wf] is considered the gold standard for T<sub>1</sub> measurement due to its robustness against effects like B<sub>1</sub> inhomogeneity [@Stikov2015-qj], but its long acquisition times limit the clinical use of IR for T<sub>1</sub> mapping [@Stikov2015-qj]. In practice, IR is often used as a reference for validating other T<sub>1</sub> mapping techniques, such as variable flip angle imaging (VFA) [@Fram1987-jj;@Deoni2003-qc;@Cheng2006-qe], Look-Locker [@Look1970-no;@Messroghli2004-iv;@Piechnik2010-be], and MP2RAGE [@Marques2010-po;@Marques2013-yg].

In ongoing efforts to standardize T<sub>1</sub> mapping methods, researchers have been actively developing quantitative MRI phantoms [@Keenan2018-px]. The International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) collaborated on a standard system phantom [@Stupic2021-hu], which was subsequently commercialized (Premium System Phantom, CaliberMRI, Boulder, Colorado). This phantom has since been used in large multicenter studies, such as Bane et al. [@Bane2018-wt] which concluded that acquisition protocols and field strength influence accuracy, repeatability, and interplatform reproducibility. Another NIST-led study [@Keenan2021-ly] found no significant T<sub>1</sub> discrepancies among measurements using NIST protocols across 27 MRI systems from three vendors at two clinical field strengths.

The 2020 ISMRM reproducibility challenge [^rrsg2020-challenge] posed a slightly different question: can an imaging protocol, independently implemented at multiple centers, consistently measure one of the fundamental MRI parameters (T<sub>1</sub>)? To assess this, we proposed using inversion recovery on a standardized phantom (ISMRM/NIST system phantom) and the healthy human brain. Specifically, **this challenge explored whether the acquisition details provided in a seminal paper on T<sub>1</sub> mapping [@Barral2010-qm] is sufficient to ensure the reproducibility across independent research groups.**


2     |     METHODS
===================


2.1     |     Phantom and human data
------------------------------------


# 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; METHODS

## 2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Phantom and human data


The challenge asked researchers with access to the ISMRM/NIST system phantom [@Stupic2021-hu] (Premium System Phantom, CaliberMRI, Boulder, Colorado) to measure T<sub>1</sub> maps of the phantom’s T<sub>1</sub> plate (Table 1). Researchers who participated in the challenge were instructed to record the temperature before and after scanning the phantom using the phantom's internal thermometer. Instructions for positioning and setting up the phantom were devised by NIST and were provided to researchers through the NIST website [^nist-website]. In brief, the instructions explained how to orient the phantom and how long the phantom should be in the scanner room prior to scanning to achieve thermal equilibrium.

Researchers were also instructed to collect T<sub>1</sub> maps in healthy human brains, and were asked to measure a single slice positioned parallel to the anterior commissure - posterior commissure (AC-PC) line. Prior to imaging, the imaging subjects consented [^informed-consent] to share their de-identified data with the challenge organizers and on the Open Science Framework ([OSF.io](http://www.OSF.io)) website. As the submitted data was a single slice, the researchers were not instructed to de-face the data of their imaging subjects. Researchers submitting human data provided written confirmation to the organizers that their data was acquired in accordance with their institutional ethics committee (or equivalent regulatory body) and that the subjects had consented to data sharing as outlined in the challenge.


2.2     |     MRI Acquisition Protocol
--------------------------------------

Researchers followed the inversion recovery T<sub>1</sub> mapping protocol optimized for the human brain as described in the paper published by Barral et al. [@Barral2010-qm], which used: TR = 2550 ms, TIs = 50, 400, 1100, 2500 ms, TE = 14 ms, 2 mm slice thickness and 1×1 mm<sup>2</sup> in-plane resolution. Note that this protocol is not suitable for fitting models that assume TR > 5T1. Instead, the more general Barral et al. [@Barral2010-qm] fitting model described in Section 2.4 can be used, and this model is compatible with both magnitude-only and complex data. Researchers were instructed to closely adhere to this protocol and report any deviations due to technical limitations.


2.3     |     Data Submissions
------------------------------

Data submissions for the challenge were handled through a GitHub repository ([https://github.com/rrsg2020/data_submission](https://github.com/rrsg2020/data_submission)), enabling a standardized and transparent process. All datasets were converted to the NIfTI format, and images for all TIs were concatenated into a single NIfTI file. Each submission included a YAML file to store additional information (submitter details, acquisition details, and phantom or human subject details). Submissions were reviewed [^submission-review], and following acceptance the datasets were uploaded to OSF.io ([osf.io/ywc9g/](http://www.osf.io/ywc9g/)). A Jupyter Notebook [@Kluyver2016-nl;@Beg2021-ps] pipeline using qMRLab [@Karakuzu2020-ul;@Cabana2015-zg] was used to process the T<sub>1</sub> maps and to conduct quality-control checks. MyBinder links to Jupyter notebooks that reproduced each T<sub>1</sub> map were shared in each respective submission GitHub issue to easily reproduce the results in web browsers while maintaining consistent computational environments. Eighteen submissions were included in the analysis, which resulted in 39 T<sub>1</sub> maps of the NIST/system phantom, and 56 brain T<sub>1</sub> maps. Figure 1 illustrates all the submissions that acquired phantom data (Figure 1-a) and human data (Figure 1-b), the MRI scanner vendors, and the resulting T<sub>1</sub> mapping datasets. Some submissions included measurements where both complex and magnitude-only data from the same acquisition were used to fit T<sub>1</sub> maps, thus the total number of unique acquisitions is lower than the numbers reported above (27 for phantom data and 44 for human data). The datasets were collected on systems from three MRI manufacturers (Siemens, GE, Philips) and were acquired at 3T [^three-t], except for one dataset acquired at 0.35T (the ViewRay MRidian MR-linac).

</p>


2.4     |     Data Processing
-----------------------------

A reduced-dimension non-linear least squares (RD-NLS) approach was used to fit the complex general inversion recovery signal equation:

where a and b are complex constants. This approach, developed by Barral et al. [@Barral2010-qm], offers a model for the general T<sub>1</sub> signal equation without relying on the long-TR approximation. The a and b constants inherently factor TR in them, as well as other imaging parameters such as excitation pulse angle, inversion pulse flip angles, TR, TE, TI, and a constant that has contributions from T<sub>2</sub> and the receive coil sensitivity. Barral et al. [31] shared their MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) code for the fitting algorithm used in their paper [^their-paper]. Magnitude-only data were fitted to a modified version of Eq. 1 (Eq. 15 of Barral et al. 2010) with signal-polarity restoration by finding the signal minima, fitting the inversion recovery curve for two cases (data points for TI < TI<sub>minimum</sub> flipped, and data points for TI ≤ TI<sub>minimum</sub> flipped), and selecting the case that resulted in the best fit based on minimizing the residual between the model and the measurements [^residual]. This code is available as part of the open-source software qMRLab [@Karakuzu2020-ul;@Cabana2015-zg], which provides a standardized application program interface (API) to call the fitting in MATLAB/Octave scripts.


A data processing pipeline was written using MATLAB/Octave in a Jupyter Notebook. This pipeline downloads every dataset from OSF.io ([osf.io/ywc9g/](http://www.osf.io/ywc9g/)), loads its configuration file, fits the T</sub>1</sub> maps, and then saves them to NIfTI and PNG formats. The code is available on GitHub ([https://github.com/rrsg2020/t1_fitting_pipeline](https://github.com/rrsg2020/t1_fitting_pipeline), filename: RRSG_T1_fitting.ipynb). Finally, T<sub>1</sub> maps were manually uploaded to OSF ([osf.io/ywc9g/](http://WWW.osf.io/ywc9g/)).

2.5     |     Image Labeling & Registration
-------------------------------------------


The T<sub>1</sub> plate (NiCl<sub>2</sub> array) of the phantom has 14 spheres that were labeled as the regions-of-interest (ROI) using a numerical mask template created in MATLAB, provided by NIST researchers (Figure 1-c). To avoid potential edge effects in the T<sub>1</sub> maps, the ROI labels were reduced to 60% of the expected sphere diameter. A registration pipeline in Python using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) {cite}`Avants2009-cw` was developed and shared in the analysis repository of our GitHub organization ([https://github.com/rrsg2020/analysis](https://github.com/rrsg2020/analysis), filename: register_t1maps_nist.py, commit ID: 8d38644). Briefly, a label-based registration was first applied to obtain a coarse alignment, followed by an affine registration (gradientStep: 0.1, metric: cross correlation, number of steps: 3, iterations: 100/100/100, smoothness: 0/0/0, sub-sampling: 4/2/1) and a BSplineSyN registration (gradientStep:0.5, meshSizeAtBaseLevel:3, number of steps: 3, iterations: 50/50/10, smoothness: 0/0/0, sub-sampling: 4/2/1). The ROI labels template was nonlinearly registered to each T<sub>1</sub> map uploaded to OSF.


For human data, manual ROIs were segmented by a single researcher (M.B., 11+ years of neuroimaging experience) using FSLeyes {cite}`McCarthy2019-qd` in four regions (Figure 1-d): located in the genu, splenium, deep gray matter, and cortical gray matter. Automatic segmentation was not used because the data were single-slice and there was inconsistent slice positioning between datasets.


2.6     |     Analysis and Statistics
-------------------------------------

Analysis code and scripts were developed and shared in a version-controlled public GitHub repository [^public-repo]. The T<sub>1</sub> fitting and data analysis were performed by M.B., one of the challenge organizers. Computational environment requirements were containerized in Docker [@Merkel2014-cu;@Boettiger2015-vd] to create an executable environment that allows for analysis reproduction in a web browser via MyBinder [^my-binder] [@Project_Jupyter2018-ll]. Backend Python files handled reference data, database operations, ROI masking, and general analysis tools. Configuration files handled dataset information, and the datasets were downloaded and pooled using a script (`make_pooled_datasets.py`). The databases were created using a reproducible Jupyter Notebook script and subsequently saved in the repository.

The mean T<sub>1</sub> values of the ISMRM/NIST phantom data for each ROI were compared with temperature-corrected reference values and visualized in three different types of plots (linear axes, log-log axes, and error relative to the reference value). Temperature correction involved nonlinear interpolation [^nonlinear] of a NIST reference table of T<sub>1</sub> values for temperatures ranging from 16 °C to 26 °C (2 °C intervals) as specified in the phantom’s technical specifications. For the human datasets, the mean and standard deviations for each tissue ROI were calculated from all submissions across all sites. Two submissions (one of phantom data – submission 6 in Figure 1-a, and one of human data – submission 18 in Figure 1-b) were received that measured large T<sub>1</sub> mapping datasets. Submission 6 consisted of data from one traveling phantom acquired at seven Philips imaging sites, and submission 18 was a large cohort of volunteers that were imaged on two 3T scanners, one GE and one Philips. These datasets (identified in orange in Figures 1, 3, and 4) were used to calculate intra-submission coefficients of variation (COV) (one per scanner/volunteer, identified by asterisks in Figure 1-a and 1-b), and inter-submission COVs were calculated using one T<sub>1</sub> map from each of these (orange) along with one from all other submissions [^phantom-version] (identified as green in Figures 1, 3, and 4, and the T<sub>1</sub> maps used in those COV calculations are also indicated with asterisks in Figure 1-a and 1-b). All quality assurance and analysis plot images were stored in the repository. Additionally, the database files of ROI values and acquisition details for all submissions were also stored in the repository.

2.7     |     Dashboard
-----------------------

To widely disseminate the challenge results, a web-based dashboard was developed (Figure 2, <a href="https://rrsg2020.dashboards.neurolibre.org">https://rrsg2020.dashboards.neurolibre.org</a>). The landing page (Figure 2-a) showcases the relationship between the phantom and brain datasets acquired at different sites/vendors. Selecting the Phantom or In Vivo icons and then clicking a ROI will display whisker plots for that region. Additional sections of the dashboard allow for displaying statistical summaries for both sets of data, a magnitude vs complex data fitting comparison, and hierarchical shift function analyses.

Figure 3 presents a comprehensive overview of the challenge results through violin plots, depicting inter- and intra- submission comparisons in both phantoms (a) and human (b) datasets. For the phantom (Figure 3-a), the average inter-submission COV for the first five spheres, representing the expected T<sub>1</sub> value range in the human brain (approximately 500 to 2000 ms) was 6.1%. By addressing outliers from two sites associated with specific challenges for sphere 4 (signal null near a TI), the mean inter-submission COV was reduced to 4.1%. One participant (submission 6, Figure 1) measured T<sub>1</sub> maps using a consistent protocol at 7 different sites, and the mean intra-submission COV across the first five spheres for this submission was calculated to be 2.9%.


For the human datasets (Figure 3-b), inter-submission COVs for independently-implemented imaging protocols were 5.9% for genu, 10.6 % for splenium, 16 % for cortical GM, and 22% for deep GM. One participant (submission 18, Figure 1) measured a large dataset (13 individuals) on three scanners and two vendors, and the intra-submission COVs for this submission were 3.2% for genu, 3.1% for splenium, 6.9% for cortical GM, and 7.1% for deep GM. The binomial appearance for the splenium, deep GM, and cortical GM for the sites used in the inter-site analyses (green) can be explained by an outlier measurement, which can be seen in (Figure 4 e-f, site 3.001).

A scatterplot of the T<sub>1</sub> data for all submissions and their ROIs is shown in Figure 4 (phantom a-c, and human brains d-f). The NIST phantom T<sub>1</sub> measurements are presented in each plot for different axes types (linear, log, and error) to better visualize the results. Figure 4-a shows good agreement for this dataset in comparison with the temperature-corrected reference T<sub>1</sub> values. However, this trend did not persist for low T<sub>1</sub> values (T<sub>1</sub> < 100-200 ms), as seen in the log-log plot (Figure 4-b), which was expected because the imaging protocol is optimized for human brain T<sub>1</sub> values (T<sub>1</sub> > 500 ms). Higher variability is seen at long T<sub>1</sub> values (T<sub>1</sub> ~ 2000 ms) in Figure 4-a. Errors exceeding 10% are observed in the phantom spheres with T1 values below 300 ms (Figure 4-c), and 3-4 measurements with outlier values exceeding 10% error were observed in the human brain tissue range (~500-2000 ms).

Figure 4 d-f displays the scatter plot data for human datasets submitted to this challenge, showing mean and standard deviation T<sub>1</sub> values for the WM (genu and splenium) and GM (cerebral cortex and deep GM) ROIs. Mean WM T<sub>1</sub> values across all submissions were 828 ± 38 ms in the genu and 852 ± 49 ms in the splenium, and mean GM T<sub>1</sub> values were 1548 ± 156 ms in the cortex and 1188 ± 133 ms in the deep GM, with less variations overall in WM compared to GM, possibly due to better ROI placement and less partial voluming in WM. The lower standard deviations for the ROIs of human database ID site 9 (by submission 18, Figure 1, and seen in orange in Figure 4d-g) are due to good slice positioning, cutting through the AC-PC line and the genu for proper ROI placement, particularly for the corpus callosum and deep GM.

4     |     DISCUSSION
----------------------

This challenge focused on exploring if different research groups could reproduce T<sub>1</sub> maps based on the protocol information reported in a seminal publication [@Barral2010-qm]. Eighteen submissions independently implemented the inversion recovery T<sub>1</sub> mapping acquisition protocol as outlined in Barral et al. [@Barral2010-qm], and reported T<sub>1</sub> mapping data in a standard quantitative MRI phantom and/or human brains at 27 MRI sites, using systems from three different vendors (GE, Philips, Siemens). The collaborative effort produced an open-source database of 94 T<sub>1</sub> mapping datasets, including 38 ISMRM/NIST phantom and 56 human brain datasets. The inter-submission variability was twice as high as the intra-submission variability in both phantom and human brain T<sub>1</sub> measurements, **demonstrating that written instructions communicated via a PDF are not enough for reproducibility in quantitative MRI**. This study reports the inherent uncertainty in T<sub>1</sub> measures across independent research groups, which brings us one step closer to producing a practical baseline of variations for this metric.

Overall, our approach did show improvement in the reproducibility of T<sub>1</sub> measurements in vivo compared to researchers implementing T<sub>1</sub> mapping protocols completely independently (i.e. with no central guidance), as literature T<sub>1</sub> values in vivo vary more than reported here (e.g., Bojorquez et al. [@Bojorquez2017-xh] reports that reported T<sub>1</sub> values in WM vary between 699 to 1735 ms in published literature). We were aware that coordination was essential for a quantitative MRI challenge, which is why the protocol specifications we provided to researchers were more detailed than any guidelines for quantitative MR imaging that were available at the time. Yet, even in combination with the same T<sub>1</sub> mapping processing tools, this level of description (a PDF + post-processing tools) leaves something to be desired. 

This analysis highlights that more information is needed to unify all the aspects of a pulse sequence across sites, beyond what is routinely reported in a scientific publication. However, in a vendor-specific setting, this is a major challenge given the disparities between proprietary development libraries [@Gracien2020-ak]. Vendor-neutral pulse sequence design platforms [@Layton2017-dy;@Cordes2020-au;@Karakuzu2022-af] have emerged as a powerful solution to standardize sequence components at the implementation level (e.g., RF pulse shape, gradients, etc.). Vendor neutrality has been shown to significantly reduce the variability of T<sub>1</sub> maps acquired using VFA across vendors [@Karakuzu2022-af]. In the absence of a vendor-neutral framework, a vendor-specific alternative is the implementation of a strategy to control the saturation of MT across TRs [@A_G_Teixeira2020-bw]. Nevertheless, this approach can still benefit from a vendor-neutral protocol to enhance accessibility and unify implementations. This is because vendor-specific constraints are recognized to impose limitations on the adaptability of sequences, resulting in significant variability even when implementations are closely aligned within their respective vendor-specific development environments [@Lee2019-ei].

The 2020 Reproducibility Challenge, jointly organized by the Reproducible Research and Quantitative MR ISMRM study groups, led to the creation of a large open database of standard quantitative MR phantom and human brain inversion recovery T<sub>1</sub> maps. These maps were measured using independently implemented imaging protocols on MRI scanners from three different manufacturers. All collected data, processing pipeline code, computational environment files, and analysis scripts were shared with the goal of promoting reproducible research practices, and an interactive dashboard was developed to broaden the accessibility and engagement of the resulting datasets (https://rrsg2020.dashboards.neurolibre.org). The differences in stability between independently implemented (inter-submission) and centrally shared (intra-submission) protocols observed both in phantoms and in vivo could help inform future meta-analyses of quantitative MRI metrics [@Mancini2020-sv;@Lazari2021-oy] and better guide multi-center collaborations.

By providing access and analysis tools for this multi-center T<sub>1</sub> mapping dataset, we aim to provide a benchmark for future T<sub>1</sub> mapping approaches. We also hope that this dataset will inspire new acquisition, analysis, and standardization techniques that address non-physiological sources of variability in T<sub>1</sub> mapping. This could lead to more robust and reproducible quantitative MRI and ultimately better patient care.

[^submission-review]: Submissions were reviewed by MB and AK. Submission guidelines (https://github.com/rrsg2020/data_submission/blob/master/README.md) and a GitHub issue checklist (https://github.com/rrsg2020/data_submission/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/data-submission-request.md) were checked. Lastly, the submitted data was passed to the T<sub>1</sub> processing pipeline and verified for quality and expected values. Feedback was sent to the authors if their submission did not adhere to the requested guidelines, or if issues with the submitted datasets were found and if possible, corrected (e.g., scaling issues between inversion time data points).

[^three-t]: Strictly speaking, not all manufacturers operate at 3.0 T. Even though this is the field strength advertised by the system manufacturers, there is some deviation in actual field strength between vendors. The actual center frequencies are typically reported in the DICOM files, and these were shared for most datasets and are available in our OSF.io repository (https://osf.io/ywc9g/). From these datasets, the center frequencies imply participants that used GE and Philips scanners were at 3.0T (`~`127.7 MHz), whereas participants that used Siemens scanners were at 2.89T (`~`123.2 MHz). For simplicity, we will always refer to the field strength in this article as 3T.

[^nonlinear]: The T<sub>1</sub> values vs temperature tables reported by the phantom manufacturer did not always exhibit a linear relationship. We explored the use of spline fitting on the original data and quadratic fitting on the log-log representation of the data, Both methods yielded good results, and we opted to use the latter in our analyses. The code is found [here](https://github.com/rrsg2020/analysis/blob/master/src/nist.py), and a Jupyter Notebook used in temperature interpolation development is [here](https://github.com/rrsg2020/analysis/blob/master/temperature_correction.ipynb).

[^phantom-version]: Only T<sub>1</sub> maps measured using phantom version 1 were included in this inter-submission COV, as including both sets would have increased the COV due to the differences in reference T<sub>1</sub> values. There were seven research groups that used version 1, and six that used version 2.
